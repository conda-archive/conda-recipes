  summary: httpuv provides low-level socket and protocol support for handling HTTP and WebSocket
    requests directly from within R. It is primarily intended as a building block for
    other packages, rather than making it particularly easy to create complete web applications
    using httpuv alone. httpuv is built on top of the libuv and http-parser C libraries,
    both of which were developed by Joyent, Inc. (See LICENSE file for libuv and http-parser
    license information.)
