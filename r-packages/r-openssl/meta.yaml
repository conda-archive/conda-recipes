  summary: Bindings to OpenSSL libssl and libcrypto, plus custom SSH pubkey parsers. Supports
    RSA, DSA and EC curves P-256, P-384 and P-521. Cryptographic signatures can either
    be created and verified manually or via x509 certificates. AES can be used in cbc,
    ctr or gcm mode for symmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric (public key) encryption
    or EC for Diffie Hellman. High-level envelope functions combine RSA and AES for
    encrypting arbitrary sized data. Other utilities include key generators, hash functions
    (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a secure random number generator, and
    'bignum' math methods for manually performing crypto calculations on large multibyte
    integers.
