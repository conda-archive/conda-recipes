  summary: Interactive plotting functions for use within RStudio. The manipulate function accepts
    a plotting expression and a set of controls (e.g. slider, picker, checkbox, or button)
    which are used to dynamically change values within the expression. When a value
    is changed using its corresponding control the expression is automatically re-executed
    and the plot is redrawn.
