  summary: The R6 package allows the creation of classes with reference semantics, similar to
    R's built-in reference classes. Compared to reference classes, R6 classes are simpler
    and lighter-weight, and they are not built on S4 classes so they do not require
    the methods package. These classes allow public and private members, and they support
    inheritance, even when the classes are defined in different packages.
