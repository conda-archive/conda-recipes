  summary: TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data
    flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph
    edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between
    them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more
    CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow
    was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain
    Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes
    of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system
    is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.
