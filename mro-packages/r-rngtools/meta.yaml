  summary: This package contains a set of functions for working with Random Number Generators
    (RNGs). In particular, it defines a generic S4 framework for getting/setting the
    current RNG, or RNG data that are embedded into objects for reproducibility. Notably,
    convenient default methods greatly facilitate the way current RNG settings can be
    changed.
