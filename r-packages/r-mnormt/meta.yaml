  summary: Functions are provided for computing the density and the distribution function of
    multivariate normal and "t" random variables, and for generating random vectors
    sampled from these distributions.   Probabilities are computed via non-Monte Carlo
    methods; different routines  are used in the case d=1, d=2, d>2, if d denotes the
    number of dimensions.
