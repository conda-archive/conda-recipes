  summary: Supports the analysis of Oceanographic data, including 'ADCP' measurements, measurements
    made with 'argo' floats, 'CTD' measurements, sectional data, sea-level time series,
    coastline and topographic data, etc. Provides specialized functions for calculating
    seawater properties such as potential temperature in either the 'UNESCO' or 'TEOS-10'
    equation of state. Produces graphical displays that conform to the conventions of
    the Oceanographic literature.
