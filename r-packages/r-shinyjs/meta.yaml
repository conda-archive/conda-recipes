  summary: 'Perform common useful JavaScript operations in Shiny apps that will greatly improve
    your apps without having to know any JavaScript. Examples include: hiding an element,
    disabling an input, resetting an input back to its original value, delaying code
    execution by a few seconds, and many more useful functions for both the end user
    and the developer. ''shinyjs'' can also be used to easily call your own custom JavaScript
    functions from R.'
