  summary: Differential Evolution (DE) stochastic algorithms for global optimization of problems
    with and without constraints. The aim is to curate a collection of its state-of-the-art
    variants that (1) do not sacrifice simplicity of design, (2) are essentially tuning-free,
    and (3) can be efficiently implemented directly in the R language. Currently, it
    only provides an implementation of the 'jDE' algorithm by Brest et al. (2006) <doi:10.1109/TEVC.2006.872133>.
