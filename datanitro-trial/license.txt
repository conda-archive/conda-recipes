If during this time period the Software does not perform as warranted, Company shall, at its option, correct the Software or, replace such Software free of charge.  The foregoing are Customer's sole and exclusive remedies for breach of warranty.  The warranty set forth above is made to and for the benefit of Customer only.  The warranty will apply only if:
(a)	the Software has been properly installed and used at all times and in accordance with the instructions for use; and
(b)	no modification, alteration or addition has been made to the Software by persons other than Company or Company's authorized representative;

COMPANY'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR DAMAGES WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY CUSTOMER TO COMPANY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. The provisions of this Section 6 allocate risks under this Agreement between Customer and Company.  Company's pricing of the Software reflects this allocation of risks and limitation of liability.

Company will have the exclusive right to defend any such claim, action or allegation and make settlements thereof at its own discretion, and Customer may not settle or compromise such claim, action or allegation, except with prior written consent of Company.  Customer shall give such assistance and information as Company may reasonably require to settle or oppose such claims.
7.2	Options.  In the event any such infringement, claim, action or allegation is brought or threatened, Company may, at its sole option and expense:
(a)	procure for Customer the right to continue use of the Software or infringing part thereof; or

(c)	terminate this Agreement and repay to Customer a portion, if any, of the License Fee equal to the amount paid by Customer less 1/48 thereof for each month or portion thereof that this Agreement has been in effect.  Company and Customer will then be released from any further obligation to the other under this Agreement, except for the obligations of indemnification provided for above and such other obligations that survive termination.
7.3	Exclusions  The foregoing obligations will not apply to the extent the infringement arises as a result of modifications to the Software made by any party other than Company or Company's authorized representative.
