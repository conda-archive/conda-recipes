  summary: Test in mixed effects models. Attention is on mixed effects models as implemented
    in the 'lme4' package. This package implements a parametric bootstrap test and a
    Kenward Roger modification of F-tests for linear mixed effects models and a parametric
    bootstrap test for generalized linear mixed models.
