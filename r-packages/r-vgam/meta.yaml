  summary: An implementation of about 6 major classes of statistical regression models. At the
    heart of it are the vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes.
    Currently only fixed-effects models are implemented, i.e., no random-effects models.
    Many (150+) models and distributions are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation
    (MLE) or penalized MLE, using Fisher scoring. VGLMs can be loosely thought of as
    multivariate GLMs. VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs (i.e., with smoothing). The other
    classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs,
    RCIMs (row-column interaction models)---these classes perform constrained and unconstrained
    quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO) models in ecology, as well as constrained additive
    ordination (CAO). Note that these functions are subject to change, especially before
    version 1.0.0 is released; see the NEWS file for latest changes.
