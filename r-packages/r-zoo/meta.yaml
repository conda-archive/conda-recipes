  summary: An S3 class with methods for totally ordered indexed observations. It is particularly
    aimed at irregular time series of numeric vectors/matrices and factors. zoo's key
    design goals are independence of a particular index/date/time class and consistency
    with ts and base R by providing methods to extend standard generics.
