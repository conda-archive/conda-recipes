  summary: "The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library"
  description: |
    GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
    signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers. There is
    no practical limit to the precision except the ones implied by the
    available memory in the machine GMP runs on. GMP has a rich set of
    functions, and the functions have a regular interface.
