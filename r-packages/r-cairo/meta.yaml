  summary: This package provides a Cairo graphics device that can be use to create high-quality
    vector (PDF, PostScript and SVG) and bitmap output (PNG,JPEG,TIFF), and high-quality
    rendering in displays (X11 and Win32). Since it uses the same back-end for all output,
    copying across formats is WYSIWYG. Files are created without the dependence on X11
    or other external programs. This device supports alpha channel (semi-transparent
    drawing) and resulting images can contain transparent and semi-transparent regions.
    It is ideal for use in server environments (file output) and as a replacement for
    other devices that don't have Cairo's capabilities such as alpha support or anti-aliasing.
    Backends are modular such that any subset of backends is supported.
