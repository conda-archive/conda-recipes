  summary: Support for measurement units in R vectors; automatic propagation, conversion, derivation
    and simplification of units; raising errors in case of unit incompatibility. Compatible
    with the difftime class. Uses the UNIDATA udunits library and unit database for
    unit conversion and compatibility checking.
