  summary: "isl is a thread-safe C library for manipulating sets and relations of integer points bounded by affine constraints."
  description: |
    isl is a library for manipulating sets and relations of integer points
    bounded by linear constraints. Supported operations on sets include
    intersection, union, set difference, emptiness check, convex hull,
    (integer) affine hull, integer projection, computing the lexicographic
    minimum using parametric integer programming, coalescing and parametric
    vertex enumeration. It also includes an ILP solver based on generalized
    basis reduction, transitive closures on maps (which may encode infinite
    graphs), dependence analysis and bounds on piecewise step-polynomials.
