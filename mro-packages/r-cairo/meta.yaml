  summary: Cairo graphics device that can be use to create high-quality vector (PDF, PostScript
    and SVG) and bitmap output (PNG,JPEG,TIFF), and high-quality rendering in displays
    (X11 and Win32). Since it uses the same back-end for all output, copying across
    formats is WYSIWYG. Files are created without the dependence on X11 or other external
    programs. This device supports alpha channel (semi-transparent drawing) and resulting
    images can contain transparent and semi-transparent regions. It is ideal for use
    in server environments (file output) and as a replacement for other devices that
    don't have Cairo's capabilities such as alpha support or anti-aliasing. Backends
    are modular such that any subset of backends is supported.
