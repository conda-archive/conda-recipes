  summary: Port of the new 'matplotlib' color maps ('viridis' - the default -, 'magma', 'plasma'
    and 'inferno') to 'R'. 'matplotlib' <http://matplotlib.org/ > is a popular plotting
    library for 'python'. These color maps are designed in such a way that they will
    analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when
    converted to black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by readers
    with the most common form of color blindness.
