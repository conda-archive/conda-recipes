# package:
#   name: bsdiff4       # lower case name of package, may contain '-' but no spaces
#   version: "1.1.4"    # version of package. Should use the PEP-386 verlib
#                       # conventions. Note that YAML will interpret
#                       # versions like 1.0 as floats, meaning that 1.0 will
#                       # be the same as 1. To avoid this, always put the
#                       # version in quotes, so that it will be interpreted
#                       # as a string.

# source:
#   # The source section specifies where the source code of the package is coming
#   # from, it may be coming from a source tarball like:
#   fn: bsdiff-1.1.14.tar.gz
#   url: https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/b/bsdiff4/bsdiff4-1.1.4.tar.gz

#   # Patches may optionally be applied to the source
#   patches:
#     - my.patch    # the patch file is expected to be found in the recipe

# # Note, the source section is optional. If you want to specify a source
# # location locally, the easiest way is to not specify the source here, but
# # to just add something like
# #
# # cp -r $RECIPE_DIR/../src .
# # cd src
# # ...
# #
# # in build.sh (and similarly in bld.bat). This assumes the source is
# # shipped alongside the recipe in src.

# build:
#   # The build number should be incremented for new builds of the same version
#   number: 1       # (defaults to 0)
#   string: abc     # (defaults to default conda build string plus the build number)

#   # Optional Python entry points
#   entry_points:
#     # This creates an entry point named bsdiff4 that calls bsdiff4.cli.main_bsdiff4()
#     - bsdiff4 = bsdiff4.cli:main_bsdiff4
#     - bspatch4 = bsdiff4.cli:main_bspatch4

#   # If osx_is_app is set, entry points will use python.app instead of python in Mac OS X
#   osx_is_app: yes # (defaults to no)

#   # Whether binary files should be made relocatable (using
#   # install_name_tool on OS X or patchelf on Linux). See the "making
#   # packages relocatable" section below for more information on this.
#   binary_relocation: false # (defaults to true)

#   # See the features section below for more information on features

#   # Defines what features a package has
#   features:
#     - feature1

#   # Indicates that installing this package should enable (track) the given
#   # features. A package does not need to have a feature to track it.
#   track_features:
#     - feature2

#   # Preserve the Python egg directory. This is needed for some packages
#   # that use setuptools specific features.
#   preserve_egg_dir: yes # (default no)

#   # A regular expression describing files to not install using soft
#   # links. If hard links are not possible and this is set, the package
#   # will be installed via copying. By default all files are considered
#   # safe for soft linking.
#   no_softlink: (bin/path1\.py|bin/path2) # Don't softlink bin/path1.py or bin/path2

#   # Used instead of build.sh or bld.bat. For short build scripts, this can
#   # be more convenient. You may need to use selectors (see below) to use
#   # different scripts for different platforms.
#   script: python setup.py install

#   # Files that should have the placeholder prefix
#   # (/opt/anaconda1anaconda2anaconda3) replaced with the install prefix at
#   # installation.  Note that conda build does this automatically for the
#   # build prefix. See also the Relocatable section below.
#   has_prefix_files:
#     - bin/file1
#     - lib/file2

#   # Binary files that should have their build prefix replaced with the
#   # install prefix at installation time.  Due to the way this works, the
#   # install prefix cannot be longer than the build prefix.  It is
#   # recommended to build against a very long prefix. The easiest way to do
#   # this is to install miniconda into a very long path.  Future versions
#   # of conda build may do this automatically. See also the Relocatable
#   # section below.
#   binary_has_prefix_files:
#     - bin/binaryfile1
#     - lib/binaryfile2

# # the build and runtime requirements. Dependencies of these requirements
# # are included automatically.
# requirements:
#   # Packages required to build the package. python and numpy must be
#   # listed explicitly if they are required.
#   build:
#     - python
#   # Packages required to run the package. These are the dependencies that
#   # will be installed automatically whenever the package is installed.
#   run:
#     - python
#     - argparse # [py26]

# test:
#   # files which are copied from the recipe into the (temporary) test
#   # directory which are needed during testing
#   files:
#     - test-data.txt
#   # in addition to the run-time requirements, you can specify requirements
#   # needed during testing. The run time requirements specified above are
#   # included automatically.
#   requires:
#     - nose
#   # commands we want to make sure they work, which are expected to get
#   # installed by the package
#   commands:
#     - bsdiff4 -h
#     - bspatch4 -h
#   # Python imports
#   imports:
#     - bsdiff4

#   # The script run_test.py will be run automatically if it is part of the
#   # recipe
