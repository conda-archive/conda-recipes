  summary: The Hmisc package contains many functions useful for data analysis, high-level graphics,
    utility operations, functions for computing sample size and power, importing datasets,
    imputing missing values, advanced table making, variable clustering, character string
    manipulation, conversion of R objects to LaTeX code, and recoding variables.
