  summary: Support for the foreach looping construct.  Foreach is an idiom that allows for iterating
    over elements in a collection, without the use of an explicit loop counter.  This
    package in particular is intended to be used for its return value, rather than for
    its side effects.  In that sense, it is similar to the standard lapply function,
    but doesn't require the evaluation of a function.  Using foreach without side effects
    also facilitates executing the loop in parallel.
