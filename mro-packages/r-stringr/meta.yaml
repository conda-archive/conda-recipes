  summary: A consistent, simple and easy to use set of wrappers around the fantastic 'stringi'
    package. All function and argument names (and positions) are consistent, all functions
    deal with "NA"'s and zero length vectors in the same way, and the output from one
    function is easy to feed into the input of another.
