  summary: '''ZeroMQ'' is a well-known library for high-performance asynchronous messaging in
    scalable, distributed applications.  This package provides high level R wrapper
    functions to easily utilize ''ZeroMQ''. We mainly focus on interactive client/server
    programming frameworks. For convenience, a minimal ''ZeroMQ'' library (4.1.0 rc1)
    is shipped with ''pbdZMQ'', which can be used if no system installation of ''ZeroMQ''
    is available.  A few wrapper functions compatible with ''rzmq'' are also provided.'

# Description: 'ZeroMQ' is a well-known library for high-performance asynchronous messaging in scalable, distributed applications.  This package provides high level R wrapper functions to easily utilize 'ZeroMQ'. We mainly focus on interactive client/server programming frameworks. For convenience, a minimal 'ZeroMQ' library (4.1.0 rc1) is shipped with 'pbdZMQ', which can be used if no system installation of 'ZeroMQ' is available.  A few wrapper functions compatible with 'rzmq' are also provided.
# SystemRequirements: Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows, or ZeroMQ library >= 4.0.4. Solaris 10 needs ZeroMQ library 4.0.7 and OpenCSW.
