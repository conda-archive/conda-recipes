  summary: Testing, monitoring and dating structural changes in (linear) regression models. strucchange
    features tests/methods from the generalized fluctuation test framework as well as
    from the F test (Chow test) framework. This includes methods to fit, plot and test
    fluctuation processes (e.g., CUSUM, MOSUM, recursive/moving estimates) and F statistics,
    respectively. It is possible to monitor incoming data online using fluctuation processes.
    Finally, the breakpoints in regression models with structural changes can be estimated
    together with confidence intervals. Emphasis is always given to methods for visualizing
    the data.
