  summary: Implementations of functions which have been introduced in R since version 3.0.0.
    The backports are conditionally exported which results in R resolving the function
    names to the version shipped with R (if available) and uses the implemented backports
    as fallback. This way package developers can make use of the new functions without
    worrying about the minimum required R version.
