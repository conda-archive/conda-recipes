  summary: 'An implementation of about 6 major classes of statistical regression models. At the
    heart of it are the vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes,
    and the book "Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models: With an Implementation
    in R" (Yee, 2015) gives details of the statistical framework and VGAM package. Currently
    only fixed-effects models are implemented, i.e., no random-effects models. Many
    (150+) models and distributions are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
    or penalized MLE, using Fisher scoring. VGLMs can be loosely thought of as multivariate
    GLMs. VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs (i.e., with smoothing). The other classes are
    RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column
    interaction models)---these classes perform constrained and unconstrained quadratic
    ordination (CQO/UQO) models in ecology, as well as constrained additive ordination
    (CAO). Note that these functions are subject to change; see the NEWS and ChangeLog
    files for latest changes.'
