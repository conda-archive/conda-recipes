build:
  # The magic trick here is to add some tag (here 'o') at the end of
  # the build string to differentiate the pacakge from others.  This
  # way we can have multiple instances of the same "version" with
  # diffenrent dependencies and conda will select the proper one
  # according to the current features.
  #
  # Unfortunately this means that we have to recreate the whole build
  # string using a manual template for the usual py<ver> tag.
  #
  # Also, this doesn't seem to be enough to trigger automatic
  # reinstall of the packages in case the openblas package gets added
  # or removed.  I have no idea what is required for that.
