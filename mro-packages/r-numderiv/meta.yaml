  summary: 'Methods for calculating (usually) accurate numerical first and second order derivatives.
    Accurate calculations  are done using Richardson''s extrapolation or, when applicable,
    a complex step derivative is available. A simple difference  method is also provided.
    Simple difference is (usually) less accurate but is much quicker than Richardson''s
    extrapolation and provides a  useful cross-check.  Methods are provided for real
    scalar and vector valued functions. '
