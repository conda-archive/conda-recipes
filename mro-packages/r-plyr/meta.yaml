  summary: 'A set of tools that solves a common set of problems: you need to break a big problem
    down into manageable pieces, operate on each piece and then put all the pieces back
    together.  For example, you might want to fit a model to each spatial location or
    time point in your study, summarise data by panels or collapse high-dimensional
    arrays to simpler summary statistics. The development of ''plyr'' has been generously
    supported by ''Becton Dickinson''.'
