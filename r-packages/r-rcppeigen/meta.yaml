  summary: 'R and Eigen integration using Rcpp. Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra:
    matrices, vectors, numerical solvers and related algorithms.  It supports dense
    and sparse matrices on integer, floating point and complex numbers, decompositions
    of such matrices, and solutions of linear systems. Its performance on many algorithms
    is comparable with some of the best implementations based on Lapack and level-3
    BLAS. . The RcppEigen package includes the header files from the Eigen C++ template
    library (currently version 3.2.3). Thus users do not need to install Eigen itself
    in order to use RcppEigen. . Since version 3.1.1, Eigen is licensed under the Mozilla
    Public License (version 2); earlier version were licensed under the GNU LGPL version
    3 or later. RcppEigen (the Rcpp bindings/bridge to Eigen) is licensed under the
    GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of Rcpp.'
