  summary: The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding.
  description: |
    The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
    floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a well-defined
    semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for
    double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit significand).
