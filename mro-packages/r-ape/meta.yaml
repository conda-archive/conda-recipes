  summary: Functions for reading, writing, plotting, and manipulating phylogenetic trees, analyses
    of comparative data in a phylogenetic framework, ancestral character analyses, analyses
    of diversification and macroevolution, computing distances from allelic and nucleotide
    data, reading and writing nucleotide sequences as well as importing from BioConductor,
    and several tools such as Mantel's test, generalized skyline plots, graphical exploration
    of phylogenetic data (alex, trex, kronoviz), estimation of absolute evolutionary
    rates and clock-like trees using mean path lengths and penalized likelihood. Phylogeny
    estimation can be done with the NJ, BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods, and
    several methods handling incomplete distance matrices (NJ*, BIONJ*, MVR*, and the
    corresponding triangle method). Some functions call external applications (PhyML,
    Clustal, T-Coffee, Muscle) whose results are returned into R.
