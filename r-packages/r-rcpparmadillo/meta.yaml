  summary: '''Armadillo'' is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by Conrad Sanderson) that
    aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer, floating point
    and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics
    functions. Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional integration
    with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries. The ''RcppArmadillo'' package includes the header
    files from the templated ''Armadillo'' library. Thus users do not need to install
    ''Armadillo'' itself in order to use ''RcppArmadillo''. ''Armadillo'' is licensed
    under the MPL 2.0, while ''RcppArmadillo'' (the ''Rcpp'' bindings/bridge to Armadillo)
    is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of ''Rcpp''.'
