  summary: This package provides some low-level utilities to use for package development. It
    currently provides managers for multiple package specific options and registries,
    vignette, unit test and bibtex related utilities. It serves as a base package for
    packages like NMF, RcppOctave, doRNG, and as an incubator package for other general
    purposes utilities, that will eventually be packaged separately. It is still under
    heavy development and changes in the interface(s) are more than likely to happen.
