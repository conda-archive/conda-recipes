  summary: Lubridate makes it easier to work with dates and times by providing functions to identify
    and parse date-time data, extract and modify components of a date-time (years, months,
    days, hours, minutes, and seconds), perform accurate math on date-times, handle
    time zones and Daylight Savings Time. Lubridate has a consistent, memorable syntax,
    that makes working with dates fun instead of frustrating.
