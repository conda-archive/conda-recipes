  patches:
    # 0001- no longer needed. GCC_PREFIX is gone (though c++ headers still in `${PREFIX}/gcc`)
    # - 0001-Libiberty-normalize-split-directories.patch
    # --print-search-dirs needs to agree with conda's library layout for various reasons.
    # One being that otherwise `-lsomelib` will not find the library in `$CONDA_PREFIX/lib`
    # An example of where this is critical is in CMake which omits the full filepath when it
    # assumes the compiler will find it without that. This is *also* a bug in CMake as it
    # should have asked the compiler for its real library search dirs via `--print-search-dirs`
    # instead of assuming `$PREFIX/lib`.
    - 0002-Disable-multiarch-like-suffixed-lib-dirs.patch
    # We never want local software (or Homebrew) leaking into our software.
    - 0003-Disable-usr-local.patch
