  summary: The curl() and curl_download() functions provide highly configurable drop-in replacements
    for base url() and download.file() with better performance, support for encryption
    (https://, ftps://), 'gzip' compression, authentication, and other 'libcurl' goodies.
    The core of the package implements a framework for performing fully customized requests
    where data can be processed either in memory, on disk, or streaming via the callback
    or connection interfaces. Some knowledge of 'libcurl' is recommended; for a more-user-friendly
    web client see the 'httr' package which builds on this package with HTTP specific
    tools and logic.
