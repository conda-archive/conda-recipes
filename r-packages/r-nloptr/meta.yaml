  summary: ' nloptr is an R interface to NLopt. NLopt is a free/open-source library for nonlinear
    optimization, providing a common interface for a number of different free optimization
    routines available online as well as original implementations of various other algorithms.
    See http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Introduction for more information
    on the available algorithms. During installation on Unix the NLopt code is downloaded
    and compiled from the NLopt website.'
