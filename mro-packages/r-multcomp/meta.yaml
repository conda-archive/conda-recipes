  summary: Simultaneous tests and confidence intervals for general linear hypotheses in parametric
    models, including  linear, generalized linear, linear mixed effects, and survival
    models. The package includes demos reproducing analyzes presented in the book "Multiple
    Comparisons Using R" (Bretz, Hothorn,  Westfall, 2010, CRC Press).
