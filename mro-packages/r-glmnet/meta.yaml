  summary: 'Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire lasso or elastic-net regularization
    path for linear regression, logistic and multinomial regression models, Poisson
    regression and the Cox model. Two recent additions are the multiple-response Gaussian,
    and the grouped multinomial. The algorithm uses cyclical coordinate descent in a
    path-wise fashion, as described in the paper linked to via the URL below. '
