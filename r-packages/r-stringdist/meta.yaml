  summary: Implements an approximate string matching version of R's native 'match' function.
    Can calculate various string distances based on edits (damerau-levenshtein, hamming,
    levenshtein, optimal sting alignment), qgrams (q- gram, cosine, jaccard distance)
    or heuristic metrics (jaro, jaro-winkler). An implementation of soundex is provided
    as well. Distances can be computed between character vectors while taking proper
    care of encoding or between integer vectors representing generic sequences.
