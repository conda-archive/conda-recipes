  summary: 'Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source  libraries.  A large part of
    Boost is provided as C++ template code which is resolved entirely at compile-time
    without linking.  This  package aims to provide the most useful subset of Boost
    libraries  for template use among CRAN package. By placing these libraries in  this
    package, we offer a more efficient distribution system for CRAN  as replication
    of this code in the sources of other packages is  avoided. As of release 1.62.0-1,
    the following Boost libraries are included: ''algorithm'' ''any'' ''atomic'' ''bimap''
    ''bind'' ''circular_buffer'' ''concept'' ''config'' ''container'' ''date''_''time''
    ''detail'' ''dynamic_bitset'' ''exception'' ''filesystem'' ''flyweight'' ''foreach''
    ''functional'' ''fusion'' ''geometry'' ''graph'' ''heap'' ''icl'' ''integer'' ''interprocess''
