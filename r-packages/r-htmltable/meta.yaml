  summary: Tables with state-of-the-art layout elements such as row spanners, column spanners,
    table spanners, zebra striping, and more. While allowing advanced layout, the underlying
    css-structure is simple in order to maximize compatibility with word processors
    such as 'MS Word' or 'LibreOffice'. The package also contains a few text formatting
    functions that help outputting text compatible with HTML/'LaTeX'.
