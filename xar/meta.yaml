# This package is linked to Apple's ld64, but they use a very early version
# of it, not this fork. Still, it should work OK. We do not need lzma and
# may not even need bzip2 nor libxml2 however the build system ignores
# --without-lzma (and probably the others too) and finds system libraries.
# Also, I link the transitive static libraries into libxar.

  description: |
    A fork/clone of the subversion xar repository from
    http://xar.googlecode.com/svn/ that includes several
    enhancements and bug fixes including very basic command
    line signature support. This is not a general purpose
    package and exists only as a dependency for ld64. As
    such, on Darwin, it is entirely statically linked, except
    for libcrypto, which you must ensure gets resolved to
    /usr/lib/libcrypto.dylib when this library is consumed.
