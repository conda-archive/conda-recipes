  summary: 'Estimation and inference methods for models of conditional quantiles:  Linear and
    nonlinear parametric and non-parametric (total variation penalized) models  for
    conditional quantiles of a univariate response and several methods for handling
    censored survival data.  Portfolio selection methods based on expected shortfall
    risk are also included.'
