  summary: Two nonparametric methods for multiple regression transform selection are provided.
    The first, Alternative Conditional Expectations (ACE),  is an algorithm to find
    the fixed point of maximal correlation, i.e. it finds a set of transformed response
    variables that maximizes R^2 using smoothing functions [see Breiman, L., and J.H.
    Friedman. 1985. "Estimating Optimal Transformations for Multiple Regression and
    Correlation". Journal of the American Statistical Association. 80:580-598. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1985.10478157>].
    Also included is the Additivity Variance Stabilization (AVAS) method which works
    better than ACE when correlation is low [see Tibshirani, R.. 1986. "Estimating Transformations
    for Regression via Additivity and Variance Stabilization". Journal of the American
    Statistical Association. 83:394-405.  <doi:10.1080/01621459.1988.10478610>]. A good
    introduction to these two methods is in chapter 16 of Frank Harrel's "Regression
    Modeling Strategies" in the Springer Series in Statistics.
