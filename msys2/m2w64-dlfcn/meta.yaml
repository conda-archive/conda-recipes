  summary: 'dlfcn-win32 is an implementation of dlfcn for Windows.'
  description: |
    dlfcn is a set of functions that allows runtime dynamic library loading.
    It is standardized in the POSIX. Windows also provide similar routines, but
    not in a POSIX-compatible way. This library attempts to implement a wrapper
    around the Windows functions to make programs written for POSIX that use
    dlfcn work in Windows without any modifications.
