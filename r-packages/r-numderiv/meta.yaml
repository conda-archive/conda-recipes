  summary: 'Methods for calculating (usually) accurate numerical first and second order derivatives.
    Accurate calculations  are done using ''Richardson''''s'' extrapolation or, when
    applicable, a complex step derivative is available. A simple difference  method
    is also provided. Simple difference is (usually) less accurate but is much quicker
    than ''Richardson''''s'' extrapolation and provides a  useful cross-check.  Methods
    are provided for real scalar and vector valued functions. '
