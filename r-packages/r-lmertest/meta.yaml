  summary: Different kinds of tests for linear mixed effects models as implemented  in 'lme4'
    package are provided. The tests comprise types I - III F tests  for fixed effects,
    LR tests for random effects.  The package also provides the calculation of population
    means for fixed factors  with confidence intervals  and corresponding plots. Finally
    the backward  elimination of non-significant effects is implemented.
