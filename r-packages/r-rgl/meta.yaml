  summary: Provides medium to high level functions for 3D interactive graphics, including functions
    modelled on base graphics (plot3d(), etc.) as well as functions for  constructing
    representations of geometric objects (cube3d(), etc.).  Output may be on screen
    using OpenGL, or to various standard 3D file formats including  WebGL, PLY, OBJ,
    STL as well as 2D image formats, including PNG, Postscript, SVG, PGF.
